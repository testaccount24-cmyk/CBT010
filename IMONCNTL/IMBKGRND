    When the IM program starts it checks to see if it is running
 in the address space of a TSO user.  If it is IM will seek to
 provide fullscreen displays on the 3270 TSO terminal.

    If IM is running in the background the device class of the
 IEFRDER file is checked.  If it has a device class of "display"
 or "graphic" (x'10') IM will treat the device as a 3270 screen
 and will seek to use EXCP to provide fullscreen displays on the
 device, which should behave the same as would a TSO terminal
 running IMON.

    For any other device type IEFRDER is considered to be a file
 of fixed-length 80-byte records containing primary input commands
 for the IM program.  End-of-file is treated as the Z command.
 This scenario can be called "running IMON in batch".

    Batch IMON screens are written to IMPLOG as if every screen
 had been printed by the H command.  IMPLOG contains fixed-length
 80-byte records.  Not all screens (eg. the main menu) will be
 written to IMPLOG.  To direct IMPLOG to SYSOUT use
    //IMPLOG   DD  SYSOUT=*
 or equivalent.  To discard IMPLOG output
    //IMPLOG   DD  DUMMY,BLKSIZE=80
 would suffice.

    The IMREPORT file can be used in the same way as it can in
 interactive sessions.  To direct IMREPORT to SYSOUT use
    //IMREPORT DD  SYSOUT=*,RECFM=VB,LRECL=255
 although IMREPORT can be directed to a disk or tape data set
 if programmed post-processing is required.

    The IMON member contains sample JCL for a started task to
 drive a local non-SNA 3270 screen in a stand-alone IMON session
 which does not use VTAM or TSO.

    The IMONBTCH member contains sample JCL to run IMON in batch.
