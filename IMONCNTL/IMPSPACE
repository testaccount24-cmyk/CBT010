//IMPSPACE EXEC PGM=IMSPACER,TIME=1440,REGION=64M,PARM='NOSMF'
//*
//*  Started Task to accumulate DASD free space details every
//*  ten (10) minutes - data is displayed from IMON option "$".
//*
//*  IMPSPACE is started by the operator START command
//*          and stopped by the operator STOP command.
//*
//*  Use the REGION size to limit the size of the online DASD
//*  space history repository.  Oldest day's data is purged when
//*  the extended region becomes full.
//*
//*
//*SAVEHIST DD DSN=IMON.SAVEHIST,DISP=SHR   <==  Customise as required
//*
//*  If the optional SAVEHIST sequential file is specified,
//*  data is written out at shutdown to preserve history over
//*  a recycle (eg. for an IPL).
//*
//*  o  Autosave to SAVEHIST is done after midnight to reduce data
//*     loss after a system crash.
//*  o  Allocate a new SAVEHIST file with RECFM=FB,LRECL=48,BLKSIZE=0.
//*  o  Ensure a new SAVEHIST file is empty with an end-of-file
//*     marker, and has a capacity larger than the extended region.
//*
//*  By default, IMSPACER uses an SVC 78 flag byte of x'40' which means
//*  generate a type 19 SMF record if the installation is collecting
//*  volume accounting information.  A program parameter of 'SMF'
//*  specifies the use of x'80' as the flag byte to unconditionally
//*  request a type 19 record.  Type 19 records may be suppressed by
//*  using a program parameter of 'NOSMF' which specifies that a flag
//*  byte of x'00' is to be used.  The generation of type 19 SMF
//*  records is a convenient way to save DASD free space information
//*  across ipls for regular reporting by post-processing software.
//*
//*  Data can be accumulated every five (5) minutes with a program
//*  parameter of '5', '5SMF' or '5NOSMF', as appropriate.
