//IMPGAT  PROC PRIMEDS='NULLFILE'
//*
//*  IMPGAT STARTED TASK JCL  -  IMON DATA GATHERER
//*
//*  IMPGAT IS STARTED BY THE OPERATOR START COMMAND
//*        AND STOPPED BY THE OPERATOR STOP COMMAND.
//*
//*  THIS "CONSTANTLY RUNNING" STARTED TASK IS USED TO TRACK
//*  SMF AND RMF DATA FROM SMF RECORDS AS THEY ARE WRITTEN TO
//*  THE SYSTEM SMF DATA SETS.  IT EXTRACTS RELEVANT RMF
//*  PERFORMANCE STATISTICS AND SMF EVENT DETAILS AND
//*  ACCUMULATES THE DATA IN ITS OWN EXTENDED REGION.
//*
//*  THIS ACCUMULATED DATA IS THEN AVAILABLE FOR ONLINE
//*  DISPLAY BY TSO OR TSS USERS VIA OPTION "K" OF THE
//*  INTERACTIVE MONITORING PROGRAM (I-MON) UNDER MVS OR MSP.
//*
//*  USE THE REGION SIZE TO CONTROL STORAGE CAPACITY.
//*
//IMPGAT  EXEC PGM=IMDATGAT,TIME=1440,REGION=64M,
//             PARM='PERFORM=Y DATASET=Y JOBSTEP=Y DASDJOB=DFHSM'
//*
//*  IF THE OPTIONAL 'SMFPRIME' DD CARD IS SUPPLIED,
//*  IMPGAT WILL OPEN, READ AND CLOSE THE FILE BEFORE
//*  BEGINNING TO TRACK CURRENT DATA.  'SMFPRIME' MUST
//*  SPECIFY A QSAM-READABLE FILE OF VARIABLE LENGTH
//*  SMF RECORDS.  'FREE=CLOSE' SHOULD BE SPECIFIED TO
//*  MINIMIZE PRIMING DATA SET ALLOCATION TIME.
//*
//SMFPRIME DD  DSN=&PRIMEDS,DISP=SHR,FREE=CLOSE
//*
//*  IMPGAT CAN HANDLE RMF DATA FROM MVS/XA OR LATER
//*  SYSTEMS, AND PDLF DATA FROM FUJITSU MSP SYSTEMS.
//*
//*  DATA FROM ANY NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL OR DEFUNCT SYSTEMS CAN
//*  BE INPUT, ALTHOUGH IT IS HIGHLY ADVISABLE THAT EACH SYSTEM
//*  HAS A UNIQUE SMF IDENTIFIER.  THERE ARE NO CONSTRAINTS ON THE
//*  ORDERING OF INPUT RECORDS, BUT BEST PERFORMANCE IS OBTAINED
//*  WHEN INPUT RECORDS ARE IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.
