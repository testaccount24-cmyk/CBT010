               or IXLMG service/IXLYAMDA area)
----------------------------------------------------------
TAB2CFNM - Coupling facility name. (QUACFNAME)
TAB2FLG1 - Coupling facility status flag. (QUACFSTATE1/UQACFSTATE2)
CFACTV   - Coupling facility active.
CFFAILED - Coupling facility failed. (QUACFSTFAILED)
CFPEND   - Policy change pending which will delete this coupling
           facility from the           structures are gone from this coupling fa
           (QUACFSTDPEND)
CFRECON  - The coupling facility to CFRM policy reconcile process is in
           progress.  When this bit is on IXLCONNs to structures in
           this coupling facilityare not permitted. (QUACFSTRECONCILE)
TAB2POLN - Policy name. (QUACFPOLNAME)
TAB2ASIZ - Total facility space (1k blocks). Facility space is made up

TAB2SYSA - Connected systems name area. (QUACFSCNAME)
TAB2SCAL - Count of number of subchannels allocated to this coupling
           facility. (IXLYAMDCF_SUBCH_ALLOCATED)
TAB2SCAV - Count of number of subchannels available for use.
           (IXLYAMDCF_SUBCH_INUSE)
TAB2SCMX - Count of total number of subchannels that could be used for
           operations if available. (IXLYAMDCF_SUBCH_MAXLIMIT)
TAB2SCNA - Count of times a free subchannel was not available for
           synchronous immediate operation. (IXLYAMDCF_SUBCH_CONTENTION)
TAB2SCUN - Count of number of summed times for unsuccessful operations.
           (IXLYAMDCF_SUBCH_FAILEDOPTIMECOUNT)
TAB2STR# - Number of structures in the coupling facility. (QUACFSTR#)

SCPRNU   - Subchannel operational but not being used for operations.
           (IXLYAMDSC_NOTINUSE)
SCPRU    - Subchannel operational and being used for operations.
           (IXLYAMDSC_ACTIVE)
TAB2SCB  - Subchannel busy count (IXLYAMDSC_SUBCH_BUSY)
TAB2SCPB - Subchannel all paths busy count (IXLYAMDSC_ALLPATHS_BUSY)
TAB2SCU  - Subchannel utilization count - Number of times subchannel was
           picked for an operation.
           (IXLYAMDSC_UTILIZATION)

---------------------------------------------------
TAB2STRN - Structure name. (QUACFSTRNAME)
TAB2FLG2 - Structure allocation status and state.
           (QUACFSTRFLG/QUACFSTRFLG2)
STRACTV  - Structure allocated and active. (QUACFSTRACT)
STRFAIL  - Structure failed. (QUACFSTRSTRFAIL)
STRRBOLD - Structure rebuild/old.  If IXLREBLD has been initiated.
           (QUACFSTRREBLDOLD)
